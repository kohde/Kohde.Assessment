# Kohde Assessment
An assessment test which can be used to asses potential candidates

## Step 1
The first step in completing the assessment is cloning the code from the GitHub repository. Later on one would create a new branch (please use your `initials+surename` as the branch name), as the `master` branch is locked. Lastly a pull request will be required to submit your result. The pull request will make use of the new custom branch created (source) and `master` will act as the destination.

## Step 2

There are `10` assessments. Each assessment has a description what explains what is required. When the assessment is complete, you can run the unit test and see if it works.

Once the repository has been cloned and the solution is opened, you explorer would look like this:

Furthermore, your test explorer will look like this - as mentioned before the unit tests can be used to verify whether your results are correct:

The next step would be to open up `Program.cs`, found within `Kohde.Assessment`. You'll see all the assessments as demonstrated by the image below:

## Step 3

Start at Assessment A and work your way through everything. Once done, you can run unit test and see if it is successful. As mentioned before, you would be required to create a pull request. Thus, as soon as you are done and happy with your results, please create the pull request.

## Good luck!
