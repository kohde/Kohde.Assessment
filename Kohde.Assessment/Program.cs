               This lead me to make use of abstract classes and interfaces that the classes could inherit from and implement the functionality.
             * Created folders to store the respective files. Did so because in future when a solution grows it makes for easier navigation to the files you seek.
             * Within the classes/interfaces I declared the properties in Alphabetical order (Age, Name etc). 
               May seem silly because there are not many properties in the classes now, but humans tend to look for order when reading through a list.
               So should a class contain many properties you scan a class more easily to find what you're looking for.*/
